# DATA601
As part of the data science master program at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), this repository serves as the initial footprint in my jouney to formerly learn and practice data science. In this repository, you will find assignments, projects, and relevant documentation collected throughout the ```DATA601``` course.
